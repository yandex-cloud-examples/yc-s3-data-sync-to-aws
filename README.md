# Description

This scenario explains how to leverage [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions and [Yandex Cloud Functions](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/functions/) to sync newly created objects on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Yandex Object Storage](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/storage/).

The example uses the same function code for both sides, as Yandex Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda runtimes are compatible.

If you look at the code, youâ€™ll notice that it uses the same S3 API for both sides, as the AWS S3 and Yandex Storage APIs are compatible.

# Limitations

Please note that this example syncs only newly created objects. If you want some solution that helps with more scenarios out of the box please refer to <a href="../Multi-cloud S3 storage/README.md">Multi-cloud storage with Yandex Cloud and Amazon S3 guide</a>.


# Syncing two S3 buckets

Review the following example to see how syncing works.
You will need:

- Accounts in AWS and Yandex Cloud
- Bash
- Terraform 1.1.5
- [s3cmd](https://s3tools.org/download)
- jq

Configure the AWS site:
- Configure the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)


Configure Yandex Cloud:
- Configure the [YC CLI](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/cli/quickstart) 
- Prepare the Terraform environment:

```
export YC_TOKEN=$(yc iam create-token)
export YC_CLOUD_ID=$(yc config get cloud-id)
export YC_FOLDER_ID=$(yc config get folder-id)
export TF_VAR_folder_id=$YC_FOLDER_ID
```


## Quick start

### Initiate an example playbook  

```
cd example
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Check results

We will use:
- `aws` tool for AWS site
- `s3cmd` tool for Yandex Cloud site

Prepare an environment:
```
BUCKET_NAME=$(terraform output -raw bucket_name)
mv s3cfg ~/.s3cfg
```

Make sure that AWS and Yandex Cloud buckets are empty:
```
aws s3 ls $BUCKET_NAME
s3cmd ls s3://$BUCKET_NAME
```

Put the file into the Yandex Cloud bucket:
```
s3cmd put sync.zip s3://$BUCKET_NAME 

upload: 'sync.zip' -> 's3://yc-s3-sync-a6v4g3vlra/sync.zip'  [1 of 1]
 2551 of 2551   100% in    0s    24.73 KB/s  done
```

Check that the file is in place at Yandex Cloud:
```
s3cmd ls s3://$BUCKET_NAME

2020-12-08 18:41         2551  s3://yc-s3-sync-a6v4g3vlra/sync.zip
```

Check that the file is successfully synced to the AWS S3:
```
aws s3 ls $BUCKET_NAME

2020-12-08 21:42:14       2551 sync.zip
```

### To destroy everything quickly

Delete all files at AWS and Yandex Cloud buckets:
```
aws s3 rm s3://$BUCKET_NAME/sync.zip
s3cmd rm s3://$BUCKET_NAME/sync.zip
rm ~/.s3cfg
```

Destroy Terraform resources:
```
terraform destroy
```
